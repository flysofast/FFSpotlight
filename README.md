# FSFTutorialSpotlight
Spotlight tutorial view for iOS - Objective-C

This is inspired by [TourGuide](https://github.com/worker8/TourGuide) for Android. It was my attemp to replicate the library with the same workflow. It lets you add pointer, overlay and tooltip easily, guiding users on how to use your app.
